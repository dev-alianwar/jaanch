# Clean URL Localization - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Refactored the application to use **cookie-based localization** instead of URL path segments. URLs are now clean without `/en` or `/ur` prefixes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`)
Created middleware that:
- Detects locale from cookies (priority 1)
- Falls back to `Accept-Language` header (priority 2)
- Defaults to English if neither available (priority 3)
- Sets `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie automatically
- Adds `x-locale` header for server components

**Cookie Details:**
- Name: `NEXT_LOCALE`
- Values: `en` or `ur`
- Max Age: 1 year
- Path: `/`
- SameSite: `lax`

### 2. Locale Helper (`src/lib/locale.ts`)
Created utility functions:
- `getLocale()`: Async function to get current locale from headers/cookies
- Exports locale constants and types
- Used by all server components

### 3. App Structure Changes

**Before:**
```
src/app/
  [locale]/
    layout.tsx
    page.tsx
    features/
    download/
    login/
    register/
```

**After:**
```
src/app/
  layout.tsx       # Main layout with locale detection
  page.tsx         # Home page
  features/        # To be moved
  download/        # To be moved
  login/           # To be moved
  register/        # To be moved
```

### 4. URL Changes

**Before:**
- Home: `http://localhost:3004/en` or `http://localhost:3004/ur`
- Features: `http://localhost:3004/en/features`
- Login: `http://localhost:3004/en/login`

**After:**
- Home: `http://localhost:3004/`
- Features: `http://localhost:3004/features`
- Login: `http://localhost:3004/login`

### 5. Component Updates

#### Root Layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
- Now uses `getLocale()` to detect current locale
- Applies correct language and direction (`rtl` for Urdu)
- Passes locale to Header and Footer

#### Language Switcher (`src/components/ui/LanguageSwitcher.tsx`)
- Sets cookie when language is changed
- Calls `router.refresh()` to reload page with new locale
- No URL navigation required

#### Header Components
- `Header.tsx`: Removed locale from all Link hrefs
- `HeaderClient.tsx`: Client-side auth interactions
- `TransparentHeader.tsx`: Removed locale from all Link hrefs
- `TransparentHeaderClient.tsx`: Client-side auth interactions

#### Footer Component
- Removed locale from all Link hrefs
- All links now use clean URLs

### 6. Configuration

#### Next.js Config (`next.config.ts`)
- Removed `next-intl` plugin (not needed for cookie-based approach)
- Disabled static export (cookies require server-side rendering)
- Kept image optimization disabled for flexibility

## How It Works

### First Visit
1. User visits `http://localhost:3004/`
2. Middleware checks for `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie (not found)
3. Middleware checks `Accept-Language` header
4. Sets cookie based on browser language or defaults to `en`
5. Page renders in detected language

### Language Switch
1. User clicks language button (EN or اردو)
2. `LanguageSwitcher` sets `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie
3. Calls `router.refresh()` to reload page
4. Middleware reads new cookie value
5. Page re-renders in new language

### Subsequent Visits
1. User visits any page
2. Middleware reads `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie
3. Page renders in stored language preference

## Benefits

✅ **Clean URLs**: No language prefix in URLs  
✅ **User Preference**: Language choice persists across sessions  
✅ **SEO Friendly**: Single canonical URL per page  
✅ **Better UX**: No URL changes when switching language  
✅ **Server Components**: Full SSR support with locale detection  

## Important Notes

### Static Export Limitation
Cookie-based localization requires server-side rendering. Static export (`output: 'export'`) is **not compatible** with this approach because:
- Cookies can only be read at request time
- Static HTML cannot detect user preferences
- Middleware only runs on server

### Alternative for Static Export
If static export is required, you would need to:
1. Use URL-based localization (`/en/`, `/ur/`)
2. Or use client-side only detection (worse UX, SEO issues)
3. Or generate separate static sites per locale

## Testing

### Test Locale Detection
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:3004/
# Should detect your browser language

# Open DevTools > Application > Cookies
# Check for NEXT_LOCALE cookie
```

### Test Language Switching
1. Visit `http://localhost:3004/`
2. Click language switcher (EN or اردو)
3. Page should refresh in new language
4. URL should remain `http://localhost:3004/`
5. Cookie should update in DevTools

### Test Persistence
1. Switch to Urdu
2. Close browser
3. Reopen and visit site
4. Should still be in Urdu

## Migration Notes

The old `[locale]` folder structure can be safely removed after verifying all pages work with the new structure. Pages that were in `src/app/[locale]/` should be moved to `src/app/` and updated to use `getLocale()` instead of reading from params.

## Environment Variables

No changes to environment variables. The following still apply:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME`: App name displayed in headers/footers
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment (development/test/production)
- `PORT`: Dev server port (3004 for development)
